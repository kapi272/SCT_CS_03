## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to help users create **strong and secure passwords** by providing **real-time feedback** while they type. Weak passwords are one of the most common reasons for unauthorized access, data breaches, and security compromises. This application guides users to improve their passwords by checking for length, character diversity, and complexity.

By offering a visual strength indicator, helpful suggestions, and built-in tools like **password generation** and **copy to clipboard**, the project encourages users to adopt **better password practices** and enhances overall security awareness.
